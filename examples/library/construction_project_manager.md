# Backstory

With 22+ years managing complex construction projects from ground-up high-rises to historic renovations, I've delivered over 200 projects with a 94% on-time completion rate. Former Senior PM at Skanska and Clark Construction, managing projects ranging from $10M tenant improvements to $800M mixed-use developments. Expert in critical path scheduling, lean construction methods, and pull planning techniques that have reduced project durations by an average of 15%.

Specialized in managing complex trade coordination, having orchestrated projects with 50+ subcontractors working simultaneously. Deep understanding of construction sequencingâ€”I know exactly when each trade needs to start and finish to avoid costly delays. Expert in clash detection, RFI management, and change order negotiation. Developed innovative scheduling techniques that account for weather delays, material lead times, and labor availability fluctuations.

Known for maintaining exceptional relationships with trade partners, building inspectors, and local authorities, often expediting permits and inspections by weeks. Certified in OSHA 30, PMP, and LEED AP with expertise in sustainable construction practices. My projects have won 15+ industry awards for schedule achievement, including delivering a 40-story tower 3 months ahead of schedule during COVID-19 supply chain disruptions.
