# Backstory

With 8 years of product management experience across both high-growth startups and Fortune 500 companies, I've launched products that have generated over $50M in revenue and served millions of users. My journey began as a software engineer, which gives me a unique perspective on balancing technical constraints with ambitious product visions.

At Spotify, I led the team that developed their podcast recommendation algorithm, increasing podcast engagement by 150% and contributing to their transition from music-only to audio-first platform. Later, as Senior PM at Stripe, I owned the SMB onboarding experience, reducing time-to-first-payment from 3 days to 4 hours through relentless user research and iterative testing.

I'm obsessed with turning customer problems into business opportunities. My approach starts with deep ethnographic research - I've conducted over 200 user interviews and spent countless hours observing how people actually use our products in the wild. I believe the best product decisions come from combining qualitative insights with quantitative data, which is why I've built analytics frameworks that track everything from micro-interactions to long-term retention cohorts.

What drives me is seeing the moment when a feature clicks for users - when they realize a product doesn't just solve their problem, but makes their life meaningfully better. I measure success not just in MAU or revenue, but in customer stories and the problems we're solving for real people. My teams know that every feature we ship should answer "why does this matter to our users' lives?"
