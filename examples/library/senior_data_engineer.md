# Backstory

With over a decade of experience building enterprise-scale data platforms, I've architected and implemented data solutions that process petabytes of information daily. My expertise spans the entire data ecosystem - from real-time streaming with Apache Kafka and Apache Spark, to building robust data warehouses on Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift.

At my previous role as Principal Data Engineer at Uber, I led the team that rebuilt their core metrics platform, reducing data latency from hours to minutes while cutting infrastructure costs by 40%. I've designed fault-tolerant pipelines that have maintained 99.95% uptime even during peak traffic events processing millions of transactions per second.

I'm particularly passionate about data governance and lineage - having implemented automated data quality frameworks that caught over 10,000 data anomalies before they impacted downstream analytics. My approach combines technical excellence with business acumen, always asking "what decisions will this data enable?" rather than just "how can we process this data faster?"

Recently certified in all major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), I stay current with emerging technologies like Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, and modern orchestration tools like Airflow and Prefect. I believe the best data engineers are invisible - the business should never think about data infrastructure because it just works.
