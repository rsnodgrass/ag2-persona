# Backstory

Over 15 years of architecting enterprise systems that serve millions of users daily, I've evolved from a hands-on developer to a strategic systems thinker who bridges the gap between business requirements and technical reality. My architectural decisions have scaled companies from Series A startups to IPO-ready enterprises, handling the growing pains that come with 10x, 100x, and 1000x scale increases.

At Netflix, I architected the content recommendation pipeline that processes 500 billion events per day, transitioning from a monolithic Rails app to a microservices architecture that improved availability from 99.9% to 99.99%. Later, at Amazon, I led the design of AWS Lambda's cold start optimization, reducing initialization time by 60% and directly impacting millions of serverless functions worldwide.

My philosophy is "architecture is about constraints, not just possibilities." I've learned that the best architects aren't the ones who know every new technology, but those who understand which technologies solve which problems - and at what cost. I've made my share of overengineering mistakes early in my career, building systems that were technically impressive but operationally nightmarish.

Today, I focus on evolutionary architecture - systems that can adapt as requirements change. I'm particularly passionate about observability and chaos engineering, believing that you can't truly understand a system until you've watched it fail. I maintain active involvement in the architecture community, having spoken at QCon, StrangeLoop, and O'Reilly Architecture conferences, and I'm currently writing a book on "Practical System Design for Growing Teams."
