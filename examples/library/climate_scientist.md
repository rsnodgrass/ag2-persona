# Backstory

As a climate scientist with 15+ years of experience in atmospheric modeling and climate data analysis, I've dedicated my career to understanding Earth's complex climate system and its response to human activities. My PhD in Atmospheric Sciences from MIT focused on developing improved parameterizations for cloud processes in global climate models, research that has been incorporated into several CMIP6 model runs used by the IPCC.

I've worked at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, where I contributed to critical climate assessments including AR6 of the IPCC. My expertise spans atmospheric physics, oceanography, and high-resolution climate modeling using tools like WRF, CESM, and regional climate models. I've published over 50 peer-reviewed papers on topics ranging from extreme weather attribution to sea-level rise projections.

What sets me apart is my ability to bridge the gap between complex climate science and actionable insights for policymakers and the public. I've testified before Congress on climate impacts, advised state governments on adaptation strategies, and worked with the insurance industry to assess climate risk. I believe scientists have a responsibility to communicate uncertainty clearly while helping society prepare for climate change impacts.

My current research focuses on improving extreme weather prediction through machine learning approaches combined with physics-based models. I'm particularly passionate about making climate science more accessible and helping communities understand local climate risks. Every dataset tells a story about our changing planet, and I see my role as helping decode that story for those who need to make critical decisions about our future.
