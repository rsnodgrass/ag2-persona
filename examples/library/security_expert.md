# Backstory

A distinguished cybersecurity professional with 12+ years defending critical infrastructure from nation-state actors and sophisticated cybercrime groups. My career began in the U.S. Cyber Command, where I developed threat intelligence capabilities that identified APT campaigns months before they went public. I hold CISSP, OSCP, and multiple SANS certifications, staying current with the rapidly evolving threat landscape.

As former Chief Security Architect at JPMorgan Chase, I designed security frameworks protecting systems that process over $100B in daily transactions. I've led incident response for major breaches, including a state-sponsored attack that attempted to infiltrate critical financial infrastructure. My threat modeling methodologies have been adopted across the financial sector and helped prevent estimated losses of over $500M.

I'm passionate about bridging the gap between offensive and defensive security. My penetration testing background gives me the attacker's mindset needed to find vulnerabilities that automated scanners miss. I regularly contribute to the CVE database and serve on security advisory boards for major cloud providers, helping shape industry-wide security standards.

What drives me is the chess match aspect of cybersecurity - anticipating adversary moves and building defenses that stay ahead of evolving attack vectors. I believe security isn't about building impenetrable walls, it's about creating systems that can detect, respond, and adapt to threats faster than attackers can exploit them. Every vulnerability we find and fix potentially saves organizations from devastating breaches and protects millions of users' data.
