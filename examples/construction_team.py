Multi-Agent Construction Team Example

Shows how three specialized construction agents collaborate:
1. Project Manager - Timeline and coordination focus
2. Architectural Specialist - Plans interpretation and buildability
3. Value Engineering Specialist - Cost optimization and ROI

This demonstrates AG2's GroupChat pattern with PersonaAgents.

Prerequisites:
    # Install dependencies


    # Setup Ollama with Gemma3:4b (local, no API key needed)
    ollama pull gemma2:2b
    ollama serve

    # Alternative: For OpenAI instead of Ollama:
    # pip install "ag2[openai]" && export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key

    (Uses local ../ag2_persona development version)

Run:
    cd examples/
    python construction_team.py

    Create a team of construction specialists using PersonaBuilder.

    This creates a hybrid conversation pattern where UserProxyAgent serves as human stakeholder proxy:
    1. Client (UserProxyAgent) represents the human stakeholder with real construction challenges
    2. Client presents complex scenario with business constraints, then steps back (max_consecutive_auto_reply=0)
    3. Three AI specialists collaborate autonomously to analyze the human's problem
    4. GroupChatManager orchestrates using agent descriptions for speaker selection

    The UserProxyAgent here acts as a "human client proxy" - it doesn't require human input,
    but conceptually represents the human perspective and constraints in the collaborative discussion.

    4. Current budget is $65M but bids are coming in at $72M.
