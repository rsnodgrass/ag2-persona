# StructuredAgent for AG2: Bringing Clarity to Agent Prompts

## Why This Matters

AG2 (AutoGen) agents currently mix role, purpose, and context into a single unstructured `system_message`. This makes agents harder to understand, reuse, and maintain. By borrowing the successful `role`, `goal`, and `backstory` concepts from CrewAI, we can make AG2 agents more intuitive while maintaining full backward compatibility.

### The Problem

Current AG2 agent creation:
```python
agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="reviewer",
    system_message="You are a senior software engineer with 10 years of experience. Your task is to review code for quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and suggest improvements. Focus on Python best practices and ensure the code follows PEP-8 standards. You should be constructive in your feedback."
)
```

Issues:
- ðŸ¤” **Unclear structure** - Role, goal, and constraints mixed together
- ðŸ”„ **Hard to reuse** - Changing goals requires rewriting entire message
- ðŸ“š **Poor maintainability** - Difficult to update specific aspects
- ðŸŽ¯ **Reduced LLM performance** - Unstructured prompts can confuse models

### The Solution

StructuredAgent provides semantic clarity:
```python
agent = StructuredAgent(
    name="reviewer",
    role="Senior Software Engineer",
    goal="Review code for quality issues and suggest improvements",
    backstory="You have 10 years of experience in Python development",
    constraints=["Focus on Python best practices", "Follow PEP-8 standards"],
    llm_config={"model": "gpt-4"}
)
```

Benefits:
- âœ¨ **Clear semantics** - Separate concerns for role, goal, and context
- ðŸ”„ **Dynamic updates** - Change goals without rewriting everything
- ðŸ“š **Better maintenance** - Update specific components independently
- ðŸŽ¯ **Improved LLM performance** - Structured prompts perform better

## Quick Start

### Installation

```python
# Save ag2_structured.py to your project
from ag2_structured import StructuredAgent
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from ag2_structured import StructuredAgent

# Create a structured agent
expert = StructuredAgent(

## Advanced Examples

### Configuration-Driven Agents

Create agents from YAML configuration:

```yaml
# agents.yaml
principal_investigator:
  role: "Principal Investigator"
  goal: "Lead research project and ensure scientific rigor"
  backstory: "20 years experience in pharmaceutical research"
  constraints:
    - "Follow FDA guidelines"
    - "Ensure statistical significance"
    - "Consider ethical implications"
  llm_config:
    model: "gpt-4"
    temperature: 0.3
```

```python
import yaml
from ag2_structured import structured_agent_from_config

# Load configuration
with open("agents.yaml", "r") as f:
    agents_config = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Create agents from config
agents = {}
for name, config in agents_config.items():
    config["name"] = name
    agents[name] = structured_agent_from_config(config)
```

### Dynamic Role-Playing

```python
# Create a versatile agent
analyst = StructuredAgent(
    name="analyst",
    role="Data Analyst",
    goal="Provide data-driven insights",
    backstory="Expert in statistics and machine learning"
)

# Adapt for different research phases
for phase in ["data_collection", "analysis", "interpretation"]:
    analyst.update_goal(f"Focus on {phase} phase and identify key findings")
    results = analyst.analyze(research_data[phase])
    print(f"{phase.title()} Phase: {results}")
```

### Hierarchical Team Structure

```python
# Create research team with clear hierarchy
research_director = StructuredAgent(
    name="director",
    role="Research Director",
    goal="Set research priorities and approve major decisions",
    backstory="25 years leading interdisciplinary research teams"
)

project_manager = StructuredAgent(
    name="pm",
    role="Research Project Manager",
    goal="Coordinate research activities and ensure timeline adherence",
    backstory="12 years managing complex scientific projects"
)

researchers = [
    StructuredAgent(
        name=f"researcher_{i}",
        role="Research Scientist",
        goal="Conduct experiments and collect data according to protocols",
        backstory="PhD scientist specializing in experimental methodology"
    )
    for i in range(3)
]

# Create hierarchical group chat
all_agents = [research_director, project_manager] + researchers
groupchat = GroupChat(agents=all_agents, messages=[], max_round=15)
```

## Design Philosophy

### Why These Specific Components?

1. **Role**: Defines identity and expertise
   - Helps LLM understand the agent's perspective
   - Makes team composition clearer

2. **Goal**: Defines current objective
   - Separates "what to do" from "who you are"
   - Enables dynamic task assignment

3. **Backstory**: Provides context and expertise
   - Enriches agent responses with appropriate depth
   - Optional but valuable for complex agents

4. **Constraints**: Define boundaries
   - Explicit limitations improve safety
   - Clear rules reduce undesired behaviors

### Why Inheritance Over Functions?

We chose to extend `ConversableAgent` because:

1. **Consistency**: AG2 uses inheritance for all agent types
2. **Encapsulation**: Properties and methods stay together
3. **Discoverability**: IDEs understand the structure
4. **Future-proof**: Easy to add methods without breaking changes

### Backward Compatibility

StructuredAgent is a pure addition:
- Extends ConversableAgent without modifying it
- Works with all existing AG2 features
- Can be mixed with standard agents
- No breaking changes to any AG2 APIs

## Performance Benefits

Structured prompts improve LLM performance:

1. **Better Context Understanding**: Clear role separation helps models
2. **Reduced Confusion**: Explicit goals prevent task drift
3. **Consistent Outputs**: Constraints guide behavior
4. **Easier Debugging**: Know exactly what each component does
